# Remember
When you load an unpacked extension, Chrome creates a link to the folder's current location. It does not copy the files into Chrome's main installation directory. This is why you can leave the folder wherever you prefer (like your desktop, a dedicated development folder, etc.) and it will still work. If you move or delete that folder, the extension will stop working in Chrome.
